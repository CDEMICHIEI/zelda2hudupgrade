# Zelda 2 HUD Upgrade
A lua script that upgrades the Zelda 2 Adventure of link HUD
There's a lot of stuff I wish I could see while playing Zelda 2, so I made this.
Includes:
 - Displays HP and MP in numeric form
 - Displays enemy HP
 - Number keys and lives are displayed w/o pausing
 - Displays currently selected spell and MP cost
 - Displays damage taken.
 - Shows enemy drop counters
